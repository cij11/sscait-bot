# sscait-bot
BWAPI bot for Student Starcraft AI Tournament

A work in progress Starcraft BroodWar bot, for submission to the 2017 SSCAIT.

To run this bot, follow the installation guidelines for BWAPI and ChaosLauncher found here:
http://sscaitournament.com/index.php?action=tutorial

Run the TestBot1 class, then load Starcraft via ChaosLauncher.

This bot extends the tutorial bot with a build queue, force buildup, and rush on the enemy base. It will generally defeat the default AI on small two player maps.
